            <p>For my brainstorming process, it helped a lot with making the issues that I care about more prominent, specifically for LGBTQIA+ issues. With my exploration, I touched upon both the physical and digital landscapes of the LGBTQIA+ community. When analyzing the margins of the LGBTQIA+ community, one particular group of people that are excluded are those who are in the closet, and are still not ready to be physically a part of a community. Within the digital landscape, communities have been build around shared LGBTQIA+ identities, even going as specific in terms of race and ethnicity. However, in some online communities such as Facebook, you still have to have your own personal account to be able to join, thus breaking anonymity. What does it look like to cultivate and build an online LGBTQIA+ community that allows people who are not yet "out" participate?</p>
