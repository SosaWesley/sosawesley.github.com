            <h4>The Problem</h4>
            <p>Representation can be a very powerful vessel to empower marginalized groups of people, by allowing their stories to be heard and their experiences be validated. Within popular forms of media, there is a growing amount of representation for the LGBTQIA+ community, and the Asian community. However, there is still this gap for those who identify both LGBTQIA+ and Asian.</p>

            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p><strong>PEN:PALS</strong> aims to fill that gap in community and representation, by creating a digital platform centering Queer and Pilipinx narratives. The website will feature user-submitted stories that visualize where the story is submitted from, in order to represent the global presence of Queer Pilipinxs, and the Philippinesâ€™ migrant population.

            <h4>Share Your Story, Tell Your Truth.</h4>
            <p>Marginalized communities that have been overlooked and invisibilized by popular forms of media have their own powerful and impactful stories to tell.</p>

            <p>These stories carry so much power in inspiring and empowering similarly identified folks, who may be yearning for that representation in stories that they can connect to. </p>
            
            <p>These personal stories already exist within people, and PEN:PALS simply creates an inclusive platform for these stories to be finally told.</p>
