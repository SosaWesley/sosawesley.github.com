            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>For my academic research, I wanted to explore the different aspects of identities such as sexuality and cultural identity, as well as relating it to physical and digital spaces.</p>


            <h3>Filipino Culture</h3>
            

            <p>One interesting aspect of Filipino culture is that in the Philippines there is a lot of LGBTQIA+ representation on its own popular forms of media. However, their representation does not equal their rights (Mosbergen). The community is still advocating for the passage of the SOGIE (Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Experssion) Bill which is “simply an anti-discrimination” law (Casilao). On one hand you have a lot of LGBTQIA+ visibility, but there still exists a lot of discrimination that the LGBTQIA+ community in the Philippines faces. </p>

            <h3>Importance of Representation</h3>

            <p>Marginalized and underrepresented groups of people throughout history have had to come together, build their own communities for support. These enclaves of communities became a place of gathering for marginalized and oppressed groups to organize and act in solidarity with one another to advocacte for their own rights to exist, and make sure their voices are heard. These places where people meet similar people like them is also important for representation. They are not often represented on popular forms of media, so they think that a lot of their experiences are individualized and only happens to them, when in reality, some of their experiences of oppression are shared by other people like them. This form of representation can be a form of validation that their experiences is something their whole community may be going through, and in turn, can be an empowerment to challenge institutions and societal norms, so that the next generation of their community don’t have to go through the things they have been through (Onwuamaegbu).</p>

            <h3>Physical Spaces for LGBTQIA+ Community</h3>

            <p>For the LGBTQIA+ community, safe spaces were established in order to allow similar identifying folks to see another person similar to them, and also build a greater community to know what the needs are of their community. One issue with this is that for LGBTQIA+ spaces, a person’s physical presence within the space is an act of “coming out.” Those who are not comfortable of being “out” yet may feel uncomfortable in being in these spaces. As an unintentional consequence of these spaces is that it can be exclusionary to those who are not yet out (Vendira)</p>

            <h3>Digital Spaces for the Asian Community</h3>

            <p>With the onset of the digital age and the rise of social media, finding and building communities of people who share a similar identity as other people have become easier. For the Asian community, “Subtle Asian Traits” a Facebook group grew in popularity last 2018, originally started in Australia, and gaining international traction (Kwai). Subgroups have been created from the original group such as “Subtle Queer Asian Traits” and “Queer Asian Intersections” for folks who identify both as LGBTQIA+ and Asian. One issue within these groups however, is their reliance and need to have a Facebook account in order to particpate. Since Facebook is a personal social media, and the people who belong in the group can see their mutual friends in the group, it may unintentionally “out” people who may not be out yet to their friends.</p>
